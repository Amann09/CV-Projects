# Low Light Image Enhancement: 

It takes a low light or an extremely dark image as an input and outputs a brighter image using a pretrained model called MIRNet.

**Data:** Images used in the project is taken from Enlighten GAN Dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sticlaboratory/enlighten-gan-dataset) at Kaggle.
